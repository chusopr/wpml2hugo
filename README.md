# wpml2hugo

This is a set of scripts to export a [WordPress multilingual blog](https://wpml.org/) to be used with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It can work with vanilla WordPress too with some modifications.

These scripts are not fully automated and may require some customizations based on your needs and don't produce and output that is directly ready to be used with Hugo.

See [https://en.chuso.net/from-wordpress-to-hugo.html](https://en.chuso.net/from-wordpress-to-hugo.html) for more details.
